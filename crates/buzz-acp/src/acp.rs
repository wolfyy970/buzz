//! ACP client module — manages communication with an AI agent subprocess over stdio
//! using JSON-RPC 2.0 (newline-delimited / NDJSON).
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//! 1. [`AcpClient::spawn`] — launch agent binary as subprocess
//! 2. [`AcpClient::initialize`] — protocol version negotiation
//! 3. [`AcpClient::session_new`] — create session with MCP server config
//! 4. [`AcpClient::session_prompt_with_idle_timeout`] — send prompt with idle/hard deadline, return stop reason
//! 5. [`AcpClient::session_cancel`] / [`AcpClient::cancel_with_cleanup`] — cancel in-flight turn
