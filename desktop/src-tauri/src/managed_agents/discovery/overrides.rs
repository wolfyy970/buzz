///   to freeze the harness against future persona runtime edits; dropping it
///   back to inherit (as [`divergent_agent_command_override`] would) defeats

///   exception here: at create the command is machine-derived from the persona,
///   so equality means "no user divergence"; at update an equal command reached
///   the force branch only because the user picked Custom, which IS the
///   divergence.
/// - NO OVERRIDE INTENT (`harness_override` false) or NO PERSONA: defer to
///   [`divergent_agent_command_override`], which keeps the persona authoritative

///   default. This is NOT a pin — baking it would freeze the agent on the fallback
///   harness even after the persona's runtime is installed and the persona is
///   re-edited, the exact bug this resolver chain exists to prevent. Stores `None`
///   so the persona stays authoritative.
///
/// `isOverridden` from `resolvePersonaRuntime` cannot distinguish these — it is
/// `true` for BOTH — so the caller must thread the explicit user-intent bit.
