//! Behavioral tests for captured-scope relay and owner-key invariants in snapshot import.
//!
//! These tests call production functions from the snapshot import path — not
//! copies of their logic — to prove the captured-scope contracts hold when a
//! workspace switch or identity change races an in-flight import.
//!
//! `capture_agent_snapshot_import_entry` is the production boundary guard used
//! by `confirm_agent_snapshot_import` at command entry. Tests call it directly
//! with a `tauri::test::mock_builder()` AppState, exercising the real scope
//! capture and owner-key agreement checks without needing an AppHandle.
//!
//! Kept in a sibling file so `tests.rs` stays within the file-size ratchet.
//! Included via `#[path]` from `tests.rs`.
